Creating Modern Websites in RiSE

Included in this repository are assets so you can include the Latte theme in your instance of iMIS. Please note this website and theme are for demonstration purposes only and have only been tested in Chrome for Windows 10. Additionally, the theme was designed for iMIS Cloud Enterprise version 20.3.44 and some things may not work as expected in earlier versions of iMIS.

Slide show from the presentation is available here: 

A demo of this site and theme is currently available at https://imistour15132.imiscloud.com/EcoCauses/.
Note: standard Starter DB logins are active on this site. Feel free to log in, click around, and see how we accomplished these designs. However, please do not make any changes to the content on this site. Instead, follow the steps below to install the theme and site on your own instance of iMIS.
